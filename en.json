  "description": "This app is designed to help you closely follow the behavior of the cryptocurrency Solana (SOL). It recommends buying (green) when it detects a rise, and selling (red) when it detects a fall.",
  "explanation": "The app alerts you when to buy and sell using visual signals:\nGreen screen: Time to buy (enter the trade).\nRed screen: Time to sell (exit the trade).\nIt works best when the currency is unstable, and you only need about 10 transactions per year (5 buys and 5 sells). With this method, which I have tested for years, you can achieve good annual results.",
  "donation": "Try imagining, start small. If this app helped you, consider making a donation.",
  "walletLabel": "Address to receive SOL on the Solana network:",
  "copied": "Copied!",
